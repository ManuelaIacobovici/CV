An E-commerce administrator that fell in love with coding a long time ago but never had the courage to pursue it. What I love about coding is that it feels like solving a puzzle or doing brain teasers, while simultaneously getting to create something. I relish getting to bring a new feature to life or work through learning a new language or technology. During my time at Makers, I worked primarily with Ruby and Javascript. I learned a lot at my time at Makers, but there is always more to learn. I look forward to building a career in the Tech Industry. I am currently learning Python.

## Skills

**Willingness to Learn 
* During my time at previous jobs and especially Makers, I have learnt that I am capable of taking on new concepts and ideas and that I can keep pace in my environment. After learning a large amount in a very short space of time I now feel like I'm suited to a place in a fast-changing tech industry. 

**Team player 
* Adept team player. Thrive and excel within team environments. Help to nurture strong team ethos and collaboration. Agile mindset to working within teams allowing for enhanced performance and success.

**Problem Solving
* A competent problem solver. At my last job we encountered an unforeseen issue that required quick thinking and effective problem-solving. Due to a mistake with the barcode numbers assigned to a new delivery of shoes, all the shoes were erroneously marked at an extremely low price. Realising the potential impact of this error, I immediately took ownership of the situation and commenced troubleshooting. I quickly identified several issues contributing to the problem: incorrect labelling of barcode numbers during the packaging process, a miscommunication between the warehouse and the store, and a failure in the barcode scanning system. Through this experience, I realised the value of maintaining meticulous attention to detail, effective communication, and a systematic problem-solving approach in a fast-paced retail environment.

**Attention to Detail 
* I am a visual learner. Through my work I have learned to spot typos, errors through double-checking which overall saves time and improve quality.
