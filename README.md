An E-commerce administrator that felt in love with coding a long time ago but never had the courage to pursue it. What I love about coding is that it feels like solving a puzzle or doing brain teasers, while simultaneously getting to create something. I relish getting to bring a new feature to life or work through learning a new language or technology. During my time at Makers, I worked primarily with Ruby and Javascript. I learned a lot at my time at Makers, but there is always more to learn. I look forward to building a career in the Tech Industry. I am currently learning Pyton.

## Skills

**Willingness to Learn 
* During my time at previous jobs and especially Makers, I have learnt that I am capable of taking on new concepts and ideas and that I can keep pace in my environment. After learning a large amount in a very short space of time I now feel like I'm suited to a place in a fast-changing tech industry. 

**Team worker 
* Adept team worker. Thrive and excel within team environments. Help to nurture strong team ethos and collaboration. Agile mindset to working within teams allowing for enhanced performance and success.

**Problem Solving
* A competent problem solver. At my last job we had a situation where we have sold a delivery of new shoes in one night which led to identify the problem and fix it.

**Attention to Detail 
* I am a visual learner. Through my work I have learned to spot typos, errors through double-checking which overall saves time and improve quality.
