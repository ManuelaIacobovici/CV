## Manuela Iacobovici

An E-commerce administrator that felt in love with coding a long time ago but never had the courage to pursue it. Graduated from Makers Academy bootcamp June 2023 where I have enjoyed problem solving and I have learnt to value test-driven development and agile environments; I find everything about tech exciting especially the future steps of my journey.
